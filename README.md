Coherence Gravity: A Covariant Decoherence-Weighted Extension of General Relativity
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17675790

Coherence Gravity introduces a covariant scalar–tensor framework in which gravitational strength responds to the local degree of quantum decoherence. The theory produces a universal long-range 1/r correction in the ultra-weak regime, while smoothly recovering standard General Relativity for decohered matter.

This framework naturally explains:

Flat galactic rotation curves

The radial acceleration relation (RAR)

The baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR)

Weak-field and cluster lensing without dark matter

Cluster-scale thermodynamic correlations

The emergence of a harmonic outer-halo structure

Project Overview

Coherence Gravity proposes that gravitational strength depends on the classicality of matter itself.
Decohered matter gravitates normally.
Partially coherent systems acquire an additional effective potential proportional to 1/r.

This single modification unifies several long-standing astrophysical phenomena without introducing:

Nonbaryonic dark matter

Interpolating functions

New particles

Screening mechanisms

A fundamental cosmological constant

Future work explores:

Mathematical uniqueness proofs (Paper 2)

Cluster dynamics and lensing

Cosmological evolution under coherence-weighted sourcing

Large-scale structure predictions

Observable signatures distinguishing Coherence Gravity from ΛCDM

Reproducibility

To compile the LaTeX source:

pdflatex main_merged.tex
bibtex main_merged
pdflatex main_merged.tex
pdflatex main_merged.tex

All files necessary for reproducibility are included in the Paper_1 folder.
