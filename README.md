“Coherence Gravity: A Covariant Decoherence-Weighted Extension of General Relativity.”
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17675790

Coherence Gravity introduces a covariant scalar–tensor framework in which gravitational strength responds to the local degree of quantum decoherence. This modification produces a universal long-range

1/r correction in the ultra-weak regime while recovering standard General Relativity for fully decohered matter.

This approach naturally explains:

flat galactic rotation curves

the radial acceleration relation (RAR)

the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR)

weak-field lensing without dark matter

cluster-level thermodynamic correlations

harmonic outer-halo structure

📘 Project Overview

Coherence Gravity proposes that the classicality of matter—quantified through decoherence—determines its effective gravitational sourcing in the weak-field regime. Fully decohered matter sources standard Einstein gravity, while partially coherent systems contribute a supplementary potential term scaling as

1/r.

This framework unifies several long-standing astrophysical phenomena without invoking nonbaryonic dark matter or a fundamental cosmological constant.

Future work will explore:

mathematical uniqueness of the coherence correction (Paper 2)

cluster dynamics and lensing

cosmology under coherence-weighted sourcing

large-scale structure implications
