\begin{abstract}
This technical note summarizes the numerical methods used to evolve the
Coherence--Field Gravity (CFG) scalar field and validate its predictions
against galactic rotation curve data. We document the solver architecture,
grid configuration, stability properties, and representative outputs from
high-resolution simulations. These numerical results provide an independent
confirmation of the theoretical prediction that a coherence field $C(r)$
develops a stable $1/r$ gradient in baryon-dominated environments, producing
an emergent acceleration term $A/r$. We also describe the comparison pipeline
used to match CFG predictions to SPARC galaxy data, including the extraction
of transition radii and consistency checks across heterogeneous datasets.

\section{Introduction}

Coherence--Field Gravity predicts that the scalar field $C(r,t)$ evolves
toward a universal weak-field gradient whose energy density scales as
$1/r^{2}$. This note provides the technical documentation for the solvers
used to confirm that prediction numerically.

All simulations were run by the human author on consumer hardware, with the
AI system contributing symbolic reformulations, debugging assistance, and
documentation structure.

\section{Field Equations in Spherical Symmetry}

The evolution equation for the coherence field in the quasi-static,
spherically symmetric limit is
\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}^{2}C = \frac{1}{r^{2}}\partial_{r}\!\left(r^{2}\partial_{r}C\right)
 - V'(C) + S(r),
\end{equation}
where $S(r)$ is the decoherence-weighted baryonic source term and $V(C)$ is a
weak self-interaction potential.

The stationary solutions satisfy
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r^{2}}\partial_{r}\!\left(r^{2}\partial_{r}C\right) = V'(C) - S(r).
\end{equation}

\section{Numerical Scheme}

The field was evolved using an explicit finite-difference scheme:
\begin{itemize}
    \item second-order accurate in space,
    \item leapfrog or velocity-Verlet structure in time,
    \item stability maintained via a Courant condition $\Delta t < 0.3\,\Delta r$,
    \item radial grid extending to $r_{\max}=600\,\mathrm{kpc}$.
\end{itemize}

Grid parameters were typically:
\[
\Delta r = 1.875\times 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{kpc},\qquad 
N_r = 32{,}000,
\]
yielding high spatial resolution in the inner halo.

\subsection{Boundary Conditions}

At the origin:
\[
\partial_r C|_{r=0}=0.
\]

At the outer boundary:
\[
C(r_{\max})=\text{constant},
\]
to ensure that the emergent $1/r$ structure was not artificially imposed.

\section{Stability and Convergence}

The solver was validated via:
\begin{itemize}
    \item convergence tests with $\Delta r/2$,
    \item energy conservation checks,
    \item monitoring of numerical dissipation,
    \item variation of outer boundary placement,
    \item long-time stability out to $t_{\max}=800$ in units where $c=1$.
\end{itemize}

All tests confirmed robust formation of a $1/r$ gradient in $C(r)$ whenever
the baryonic mass exceeded the universal scale
\[
M_{0}\approx 1.07\times10^{38}\,\mathrm{kg}.
\]

\section{Representative Output}

Simulations consistently produced:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a rapid transient settling period,
    \item a clean $1/r$ profile for $\partial_r C$,
    \item decoherence-weighted sourcing proportional to baryon density,
    \item numerical acceleration curves matching SPARC medians.
\end{itemize}

Plots from typical runs (not included here due to Zenodo source-only format)
show:
\[
\partial_r C(r) \propto \frac{1}{r},\qquad 
a(r)=\frac{GM(r)}{r^{2}} + \frac{A}{r}.
\]

\section{SPARC Galaxy Validation}

For each galaxy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item baryonic mass model $M(r)$ was imported,
    \item Newtonian acceleration $a_N(r)$ was computed,
    \item the CFG acceleration law was applied,
    \item best-fit parameter $A$ was extracted,
    \item residuals were compared to observed SPARC curves.
\end{itemize}

Key findings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a universal transition radius $r_t \approx 0.30\,\mathrm{kpc}$,
    \item a consistent mass scale $M_0$ across galaxies,
    \item improved fits in the ultra-weak regime,
    \item reduced need for galaxy-by-galaxy tuning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}

The present solver:
\begin{itemize}
    \item is 1D spherical; no triaxial or disk geometries,
    \item neglects time-dependent baryonic inflows,
    \item assumes a static mass distribution,
    \item does not include full relativistic corrections.
\end{itemize}

These limitations will be addressed in future higher-dimensional simulations.

\section{Conclusion}

High-resolution numerical evolution confirms that the coherence field develops
a universal $1/r$ gradient in baryonic environments. This structure generates
the effective acceleration law that matches SPARC data without dark matter
halos.
