# Coherence-Field Gravity  
### A Scalar-Field Alternative to Dark Matter and Dark Energy  
**Clifford Treadwell**

---

## Overview

This project collects the source files, derivations, and supporting material for a new
scalar–field extension of gravity in which a single **coherence field** \(C(x)\) responds
nonlinearly to the trace of the baryonic stress–energy tensor.

The framework replaces particulate dark matter and a finely tuned cosmological constant
with the dynamics of one covariant scalar field:

- Canonical kinetic term  
- Quartic-gradient interaction  
- Shallow potential \(V(C)\)  
- Environment-sensitive coupling to the trace of \(T_{\mu\nu}\)

From this minimal Lagrangian, the model reproduces:

- MOND-like galactic dynamics and the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation  
- Cluster-scale “effective halos” matching X-ray, SZ, and lensing data  
- Cosmic acceleration without a cosmological constant  
- Early-time radiation-like behavior that preserves CMB peak structure

## Papers

### Paper 1 — Decoherence-Weighted Gravity

**Coherence Gravity: A Covariant Decoherence-Weighted Extension of General Relativity**  
Repository: this repo (`main_merged.tex`, etc.)  
Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.17675789](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17675789)

This paper introduces a scalar–tensor extension of GR where gravitational strength
depends on local decoherence, recovering Einstein gravity in classical regimes while
avoiding dark-matter halos.

### Paper 2 — Coherence-Field Gravity

**Coherence-Field Gravity: A Scalar-Field Alternative to Dark Matter and Dark Energy**  
Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.17715831](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17715831)

A single scalar degree of freedom, governed by a quartic-gradient Lagrangian and a
soft potential, accounts for:

- Flat rotation curves and SPARC mass–acceleration data via a nonlinear scalar flux law  
- Cluster-scale mass discrepancies through a scalar-induced effective halo  
- Late-time cosmic acceleration from slow roll of the coherence field  
- Early-time suppression of vacuum energy when the quartic term dominates  

The acceleration scale \(a_0 \sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}\) is **not inserted by hand**;
it emerges from the same parameters \((\Lambda_4, f)\) that control galactic and
cosmological behavior.
