# Coherence-Field Gravitation — Derivations (Placeholder)

This folder will contain the detailed analytical derivations supporting the main results:
- Scalar flux law
- Deep-regime asymptotics
- FRW reduction and energy conditions
- Logarithmic potential emergence
- Mass–acceleration scaling predictions
- Cluster hydrostatics
- Lensing mapping
- CMB perturbation equations

Full derivation set will be uploaded after preprint review and repository stabilization.
